During this assignment i aimed to complete most  of the core functionalities such as
being able to  add players, remove players, display an updating status bar,
remove a bet, appropriate delay on cards as they are being dealt and displaying win loss of players against 
the house on the summary panel. In addition i adhered to the visual layput which i completed as per 
specified. Due to time constraints i was unable to implement certain functionalities of the 
program. Some of these included the error checking standards, some of which i was not able to 
achieve as well being able to clear the cards after each player has been dealt their hard. I 
attempted to keep my code structure quite simple and easy to understand, as a result 
i refreained from adding comments. In order to execute the assignment successfully, 
CardGame and CardGameGUI must be linked via the buildpath.
